## Week 0
Did the proposal and contract, and began planning out which algorithms to apply. 

## Week 1/Week 2
We utilized JavaScript to download our data and clean it up, and then converted this from a JSON object and then into a JSON file. From this, we created a CSV file. We also created a Makefile. We started developing our graph constructor and started brainstorming the Kruskal's algorithm. 

## Week 3
We began actually creating and editing our graph files and node files and assigning what represents everything as per Disney World. This means we labeled our rides as the nodes and the edge weights as the distance between the rides, and so we can then translate the data into a graph that we can eventually traverse. We also completed developing the BFS algorithm and generating the output for this, but we will continue making edits to ensure the best time complexity and style of code. We also completed the Dijikstra's algorithm and writing the tests for that, as well as the Kruskal's algorithm. We spent time updating the ReadME as well as all the other MD files to stay consistent with our project. Some methods in all of our classes needed to be adjusted and we did that as well. We also fixed some errors that we ran into regarding making the overall project and resolved that.
