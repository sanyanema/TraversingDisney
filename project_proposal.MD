##Communication
###Team Meetings
Our team will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7-9pm in person at the lounge of Seven07 Apartments. Each member will be a designated notetaker, and we will begin with snema2. We will be using Google Docs to keep these notes, as well as create a Google Drive folder for everyone’s convenience. We will also make sure to keep track of our progress from the last meeting specifically in terms of code development.
Assistance
All team members have each other’s phone numbers, as well as email, Slack and Discord. This ensures that communication is our topmost priority and that all team members are on the same page. We commit to responding to any messages within 48 hours of their receival. 
Respect
During our meetings, we will select someone to lead the meeting and this person will make sure that everyone can speak and designate time to their own idea. This will allow everyone to feel included; decisions will be made with agreement of 50% of the group. By signing this document, each team member commits to this decision and any decisions made by the group so forth. Above all, the group’s decision may outweigh one’s personal decision, if accepted by a simple majority.
##Collaboration
###Work Distribution
Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the entire team and the way that we will decide who works on each task in the workstream will be by volunteering. If anyone feels like they have a heavier workload, then the team can discuss this and make changes to the workstream if needed. If a certain task is repetitive, we will try to rotate this task so the team has a chance to experience of each part of the project.
###Time Commitment
To make sure everyone does equal work, every member will contribute between 3-5 hours per week on the product. In the scenario that someone ends up contributing more time than needed, the rest of the group will work together on the workload. The team should work together as it is the entire team’s responsibility and the individuals within the team just work together to accomplish the team goal. Each week the deliverable should be accomplished, ideally by Friday at 5pm. If a team member is unable to consistently meet their deadlines, we will all work together to come up with a resolution and make sure that in the future this is avoided. 
Conflict Resolution
All conflicts within the team will be decided by a polite, honest conversation amongst the entire team with no judgment to be made.
There will be creative problem-solving and accountability when a problem rises but we will actively listen to one another’s thoughts
